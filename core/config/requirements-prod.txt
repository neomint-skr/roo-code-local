# RooCode Production Dependencies
# Minimal dependency set for production deployment
# Inherits only core runtime dependencies

# Production-optimized core dependencies (from core/config/requirements.txt)
# Only essential runtime dependencies, no development or testing tools

# Core runtime only - LLM integration moved to modules
# Testing and development tools excluded
# Optimized for minimal container size and security

# Note: This file references core/config/requirements.txt for base dependencies
# Additional module-specific dependencies loaded separately
# Use: pip install -r core/config/requirements.txt (excludes dev/test dependencies)
