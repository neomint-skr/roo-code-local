# - added_by: name of agent, tool, or user (e.g., vocab-updater)
# - origin: suggestion file or manual source

# Validation rules:
# - History is immutable - new entries only through append
# - No changes, deletions, or overwrites of existing entries
# - Each ID from vocab.yaml must appear exactly once in history
# - All timestamps must be valid ISO strings
# - No duplicates, no missing fields, no free text in required fields
# - CI can automatically verify consistency with vocab.yaml
